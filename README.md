Getting Started with Copybar
============================

Copybar is an instant CMS.  Just by using the snippet below, you can enable dynamic content editing.  

'''html
<script src="//copybar.io/USERNAME/ELEMENT_ID"></script>
...

Replace USERNAME with your own username, and then create a unique element id for each snippet.

Embed as many snippets as you want (each with its own id), anywhere you want to be able to edit content.

Run index.html in your browser, and see Copybar in action!

Note, until you have confirmed your account with a password and email, your content will be editable by anyone.
